So basiclly the art that i created is represents an op-art and i really like op-art, And what inspired me to do it is the artist and my best artist is vicotr vasarely and another thing is because i love op-art because it gives that illusional movments on the art it self it it's just beyond our expectations, and i got the information from different websites and it really helped me because they just show what specificlly happened in that time with the artist and all this kind of information and one of the great websites were (ArtOfOurhistory.org) and another websites that really helped me a lot and gave me the chance to pick my artist, and my project went pretty great but i got stuck on some issues with illistrator little bit but i got it fixed.. i was just confused a little bit but i kept watching the tutorial video and it thankfully worked for me.
i used the tools from watching the tutorial on the video but as i said i got a little bit confused because i just got on it but i learnd how to use the pincles and some different tools and how to color the background of the art and how to use the eraser, another thing is how to meaure the lenth and the size of the paper or the background you want to make your art on!!!.and i learnd how to use the brushes and the symbolss
